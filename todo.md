    - The more poop that piles up the faster the character gets depressed
- LIFE CYCLE
    - Create a life cycle for the character. If the has 0 bars for too long it will die. (maybe like 12 hours)
    - Hidden health stat that decreases every X minutes if any of the bars are empty. 
        - EX: if the hunger bar is empty but the happy bar isnt the hidden life stat will still decrease and eventually the animal will die
    - Screens for new game. On boot check if the character is still alive and if it is then show the game but if its not than show the new game screen
